Applicable non-destructive inspection methods include X-ray transmission method, X-ray CT inspection, neutron radiography, ultrasonic wave method, and acoustic emission testing method. The X-ray transmission method is used to detect defects in metallic material welds and composite materials in combination with an X-ray device of 50 k to 12 Mev and an industrial X-ray film. An inspection method using imaging technology has been put into practical use recently. The X-ray CT inspection is of data collection system, consisting of from the first generation to the fourth generation. An adequate generation is selected according to the balance between use of high speed and image quality, weight and shape of the object to be inspected. Inspection of explosive products uses radiography of thermal neutrons which permeate metallic lead, but are difficult to permeate active explosives and adhesives. The ultrasonic wave method applies ultrasonic waves of several MHz bands to metals and several hundred kHz bands to FRP. The acoustic emission testing method and thermography are utilized for inspection of composite materials. It is necessary in the future to automate and improve the efficiency of inspection systems. 5 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.",,"The author&nbsp;discussed different technologies and their present status in the non-destructive inspection for aerospace.

Many approaches have been developed to detect the fiber content of concrete. However, most of the existing methods are expensive, destructive, and mainly suitable for near-surface areas. To evaluate fibre content inside the steel-fiber concrete (SFC), this study proposes an electromechanical impedance (EMI)-based non-destructive method using embeddable sensing technology. The proposed method employs the embeddable sensors to sample EMI siganls, the concept of fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) to extract the signal features and an ensemble machine learning algorithm known as the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to classify different labels. To evaluate the fiber content inside SFC, firstly, lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-based smart spherical aggregates (SSAs) are embedded into the host components/structures with different fiber contents, and a series of admittance (reciprocal of impedance) spectra of the SSAs are sampled as the dataset. Subsequently, the conductance and susceptence (real and imaginary parts of the admittance spectra) are calculated using their corresponding FuzzyEn values as two sample features. Finally, with the help of the grid search cross-validation method, the GBDT classifier is trained to classify different labels corresponding to the fiber contents. An experimental study was conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed method, and the results confirmed the ability of the method to evaluate fiber contents inside SFC structures.

With technology advancement in cameras, the visual inspection method using drones is gaining much attention in the field of civil engineering. However, although visual inspection methods are feasible for finding cracks in structures, the limitations of image processing for finding internal damage or small defects cannot be ignored. To overcome this problem, a possible application concept of UAV, combined with a vibration-based non-destructive health monitoring method, is proposed. The idea is for the drone to temporarily attach the piezoelectric transducer onto a specific region where excitation and data acquisition occurs simultaneously. This eliminates the need for a structure to be covered with hundreds of sensors for monitoring, as this concept uses a single piezoelectric transducer for monitoring a structure. The proposed work offers new areas of research by converging UAV with a vibration-based method, as associated problems are required to be solved.",,"The authors proposed attaching PZT sensors to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aka drone, to detect defects in structures.

A large number of sensors forms the front end of an SHM system to provide information on the condition of the structure. The information from the sensors is incorporated into structural analyses and failure models to assess the state of the structure and to predict the remaining lifetime.

Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM.

IRT has applications in industries like process monitoring and building inspections using temperature measurement. This technique is also useful as an NDT method, helping predict equipment failures, ensuring product quality, and assessing the integrity of structures like bridges. There are also some limitations of the technique; most importantly it is vulnerable to environmental factors like ambient temperature and radiation. The success of IRT also depends on the emissivity of the surface of the material tested.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Oviedo, Campus de Viesques 33204 Gijón, Asturias, Spain. rusamentiaga@uniovi.es.

Processing radiographs to detect defects is, however, challenging, especially if the defect type and location are unknown. In other fields, autoencoders (AE) have been largely studied for anomaly detection. While their performance for defect detection has shown promise, many solutions are not demonstrated to be defect-independent. In this work, we introduce a radiography-based anomaly detection method that first computes the AE prediction error from an input radiograph to enhance the detectability of defects. Subsequently, the probability of the imaged object being defective is predicted by a convolutional classification network. Results on simulated data demonstrate that this method succeeds in distinguishing between defective and non-defective objects, with accuracy (which calculates how often the predictions are equal to the labels) >94% and precision (which is the ratio between the true positives and the total predicted positive) >90%, even for defects unseen during the training stage. Our classification network showed high robustness to noise (with signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 20?dB), and accuracy on noisy data >90% and precision >86%.

In the present study, we aimed to address this issue by using highly cost-efficient near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning approach. An NIR-HSI camera was used because it can recognize both molecular vibration information (i.e. chemical component differences) and its spatial distribution in each seed sample; this camera is much more informative than a regular RGB digital camera. Using this technology, the emphasis of this study was firstly to provide a methodology for enhancing the interpretability of viable and non-viable seeds via principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) viability classification analysis of NIR-HSI data. A CNN was then constructed to“cognize” the differences in viable and non-inviable seeds and classify them automatically. Experimental results indicate that the methodology produces a ~90% classification accuracy for both a five-fold cross-validation set and a test set of naturally aged Japanese mustard spinach seeds.

These buildings must be maintained to prolong their service life and monitored continuously for possible signs of building damages. Determining the compressive strength is essential for predicting the remaining service life of museums because monumental museum buildings usually comprise load-bearing masonry walls. This study analysed the applicability of three machine learning techniques as alternative methods for predicting the compressive strength of masonry constructions. A database was established by performing experimental testing on 44 masonry specimens. In the nondestructive techniques used, the ultrasonic pulse velocity and the rebound number were inputs and the compressive strength of masonry unit ($$f_{\text {mu}}$$) was the desired output. The remaining compressive strength of a museum was determined using commonly available nondestructive testing apparatus. The model predictions obtained through nondestructive measurements were compared with the experimental results obtained through the destructive testing of masonry units in the laboratory. The proposed approach was compared with traditional empirical models and commonly used machine learning techniques. The analyses revealed that machine learning techniques are robust, can successfully be used for the prediction of the remaining compressive strength of historical constructions, and thus can provide decision support for inspection professionals.",,"Mishra et al. evaluate three machine learning models for predicting the compressive strength of unreinforced brick masonry found in historic structures like museums.

Moreover, the analysis of data acquired by most nondestructive technologies is complex, time-consuming, and requires highly skilled operators. Meanwhile, the general applicability of various chemometric or statistical methods is affected by noise, sample, variability, and data complexity that vary under various testing conditions.

Identifying these defects is central to quality monitoring in the fruit processing industry. Conventionally, industries employ manual separation to segregate damaged fruits in the processing line. However, manual sorting is laborious, time-consuming, skilled labor-intensive, and destructive. Besides, it is incapable of inspecting every fruit on a fast-moving conveyor belt. Therefore, industries are looking for rapid, non-destructive, and precise technologies for the online inspection of every fruit in the process line. Scope and approach Non-destructive techniques (NDTs) such as biospeckle, X-ray imaging, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and thermal imaging (TI) involve noninvasive testing of sample surfaces. Earlier review articles have emphasized the applications of various NDTs in determining fruit quality and safety, but with limited focus on image processing and analysis. Therefore, this review focuses on the working principle of these NDTs in detecting fruit damages, their instrumentation, and the steps involved in image processing and analysis. The final sections highlight the limitations and future prospects pertaining to each technique. Key findings and conclusions Biospeckle, HSI, and TI techniques can detect surface damages due to their limited light penetration depth. The HSI spectrum is useful in detecting the defects and fruit quality parameters. Active TI can detect even minor damages in the fruit, but it is not appropriate for industrial production lines. Conversely, X-ray imaging can detect fruit internal damages. The synergistic applications of these NDTs along with appropriate chemometric procedures are useful in identifying damaged fruits without human interference and evade their entry into the processing line.",Fruits; Mechanical damage; Biospeckle; X-ray imaging; Hyperspectral imaging; Thermal imaging,"Mahanti et al. discussed the usefulness of NDI techniques in the context of the food industry and consumer safety.

This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of previous works that have been proposed in the area of anomaly detection in images through deep learning generally and in the medical field specifically. Twenty studies were reviewed, and the literature selection methodology was defined based on four phases: keyword filter, publish filter, year filter, and abstract filter. In this review, we highlight the differences among the studies included by considering the following factors: methodology, dataset, preprocessing, results and limitations. Besides, we illustrate the various challenges and potential future directions relevant to anomaly detection in images.

It generally enables not only to detect an indication, but also to classify it (size, position, nature…). Many non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques are effective in testing welded components. Radiography, ultrasonic testing, penetrant testing and magnetic particle testing are widely used and standardised. Phased arrays, TOFD and multi-elements eddy current are more and more extensively applied. Tomography, acoustic emission, ultrasonic guided waves, laser ultrasonic and optical techniques continue to be a strong topic of interest. Each of these techniques is based on different physical principles to detect defects on the surface of the part or over its whole volume. However, the geometry, physical and material properties of the part being tested are key factors in the applicability and performance of a given NDT technique. To date, the development of reliable NDT methods for additive manufacturing (AM) parts is still a major challenge. The process may generate various defects such as cracks, voids, inclusions and porosities. NDT techniques need to be optimised or developed to address singular features of the AM processes: complex geometry, special internal structures, anisotropic material properties, typical defects.

In order to assess the feasibility of detecting concrete cover degradation, velocity and attenuation measurements were made on both halves of a concrete slab. One half was immersed into an acid solution for 15-45 days, while the other half remained sound. These measurements were made for longitudinal, transverse and surface waves.

This type of testing is very time consuming, and hence expensive. In practice, composite laminates are often damage tolerant and it is frequently only necessary to find relatively large defects, for example 10–20 mm diameter delaminations. There is therefore a need to develop a testing technique that will detect defects of this type quickly and reliably; if a defect is found, conventional methods may, if necessary, then be used to characterize it in detail. Possible currently available techniques include thermography, holography, shearography and scanning laser ultrasonics. These have the potential to carry out relatively quick inspections, but are all very expensive to implement. Ultrasonic Lamb waves, which propagate in the plane of plate-like structures, have potential to be used for the long-range testing of composite laminates since they can propagate a long distance along the laminate and a large region can therefore be interrogated from each transducer position. Recent work at Imperial College has investigated the possibility of using these waves as the basis of a quick, relatively cheap method for the detection of delaminations in large structures. This paper reviews the currently available techniques and discusses their relative advantages and disadvantages, and then goes on to discuss the potential of the Lamb wave method.",composite structures; non-destructive evaluation; transient thermography; laser ultrasonics; shearography; Lamb waves,"The author discussed pros and cons of different NDT techniques like laser ultrasonic, transient thermography, shearography, and lambda wave inspection.

Further methods are classified on basis of their intrinsic characteristics and their applications. Mostly, an NDT evaluator uses only one non-destructive test method to perform the evaluation. If the scope of work is straight forward, using a single test method is acceptable. However, there are times when a single test method does not provide enough information about the material integrity and thereby combination of different methods is essential.

A theoretical study has been backed up by impedance measurements on structures with deliberately introduced disbonds. It has been shown that defects such as disbonds and delaminations may be modelled as a spring beneath which is the undamaged structure, the spring stiffness being infinite if no defect is present. The impedance at the top of the spring is a strong function of the spring stiffness, so impedance measurements may be used to detect damage. The technique is most sensitive when the defect is close to the surface and the base structure is relatively stiff.

While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution—an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches.",,"Akcay et al. introduce a semi-supervised anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which does not depend on labeled data and can effectively detect anomalies with only a limited amount of labeled data. The proposed method utilizes a conditional GAN, consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate realistic images that resemble the normal training data. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated images. This adversarial training process allows the generator to learn the underlying distribution of the normal data. The effectiveness of GANomaly was evaluated on various datasets with different types of anomalies.
